Photorealistic figurine of a smiling male massage therapist in a blister pack. He has fair skin, short brown hair tucked up on the right side, a beard, and is dressed in dark green medical clothing with ‘yashlek’ written on the side of the uniform. He wears black sandals.

The scene is lit with soft studio lighting, in sharp focus, against a clean background, in a modern retail production style.
